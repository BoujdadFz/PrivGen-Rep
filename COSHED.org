Privacy by design is growing as a fundamental need in applications developement 
of today. From specification to implementation, privacy concerns should be tackled
constructivey during the development process
for applications manipulating personal data. Genetic analyses are a typical example of such applications.
Actually, genetic data that is involved in biomedical studies carry very sensitive information like the health status of the target subject. In addition, classical anonymization methods do not apply to genetic data because of attacks that may link a genome to some individual based on phenotypic information deduced from the genome itself i.e. facial traits.
Still, collaborative studies involving genetic data from different centers are currently needed by some very widely used anlysis methods like statistical ones used e.g. by the GWAS. For instance, a research study whose purpose is to reveal 
genes involved in the developement of a rare disease i.e.Turner syndrome; 
would require huge samples which no single center may ever possess because of the lack
of patients in a limited geographical area. Therefore,
geneticists need to collaborate in this scenario in order to have significant sizes 
of genetic
data sets. Unfortunately, the serious sensitivity of genetic information  
pushes geneticists to protect their collected genomes and hence,
hamper the practical and flexible sharing of genetic data.

Secure sharing of genetic data is an active research field, several cryptographic
techniques were suggested to secure some specific scenarios. It is not rare when 
solutions may also combine different techniques to achieve the fixed privacy goals
e.g.homomorphic encryption/secure multi-party computation, encryption/fragmentation.
However, no applicative suppport was given before to safely handle building 
and querying such complex environments. In the context of the 
[[http://www.privgen.cominlabs.ueb.eu/fr/;jsessionid=940C8E5362ECF7AE4972A593E404BBFE][PrivGen]] project we aim to afford applicative support to genetic data sharing platforms in a specific privacy-aware architecture whose choice
is motivated by geneticists needs involved in the same project.

Our work for a COnstructive SHaring of gEnetic Data (COSHED) extends
a previous [[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7345388/?reload=true][approach]]  (C2QL) of Cherrueau et al.  to what fits
our needs. C2QL language enables the development of privacy-aware applications 
by the implementation of distributed algorithms composing computations 
involving encrypted and fragmented data, as well as client-side computations. 
SQL-like queries are supported on top of possibly encrypted and fragmented data. 
The approach essentially consists of two parts: language support for the development
 of secure and privacy- preserving applications and an algebraic theory supporting
 corresponding optimizations and correctness proofs.

Concretely, we suggest a distributed multi-cloud-based architecture defined with and by 
a security layer. As for implementation, we extended C2QL with watermarking functions. 
In fact, genetic data watermarking is a promising technique for integrity, 
traceability or ownership protection. These properties constitute vital requirements 
when it comes to storing and processing genetic data. We started by defining 
the commutative laws of watermarking with the already existing techniques 
by introducing the corresponding algebra of commutation laws, then, the abstract implementation shows
that watermarking can be safely integrated and correctly manipulated in a heterogenous
application.
